# Simulated Robots Package 
Minimal simulation for mobile robots using ROS2 and Gazebo(Classic and New). This package provides all of the necesarry files to get a simulated robot up and running. This includes the urdf, parameters and launch files for a robot capable of sensing its enviroment, mapping and localization, as well as autonamous and tele-operated navigation. There are two robots available: a 2-wheeled and a 4-wheeled differential drive robot. Currently four sensors are implemented: camera, depth camera, and 2D & 3D lidars. The package has been tested to work humble and foxy, it will be upgraded to work with jazzy in the near future. 

### Work in progress
The package is still being worked on and early in development

## Supported on
Currently supported:
Ubuntu Version | ROS 2 version | Gazebo
-- | -- | -- 
[Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/) | [ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html) | Gazebo Classic 
[Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/)| [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Releases/Release-Humble-Hawksbill.html) | Gazebo Classic & Gazebo

Support for [Ubuntu 24.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/) & [ROS2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html) is planned.


### Note
ROS Iron could work with the humble branches but this has not been tested.

## Branches
ROS 2 version | Gazebo version | Branch 
-- | -- | -- 
Foxy | Gazebo Classic | [foxy](https://github.com/Alexander-Levy/sim_bot/tree/foxy) 
Humble | Gazebo Classic | [humble](https://github.com/Alexander-Levy/sim_bot/tree/humble)

### Setting up your enviroment 
Before launching the simulation make sure to set up your environment by sourcing the following files, replace `sim_ws` with the path to your workspace.
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
cd sim_ws                           
source install/setup.bash
```

You need to run these commands every time you open a new terminal. If you don’t want to have to source the setup files every time you open a new termianl (skipping task 1), then you can add the command to your terminal startup script: 
```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source <path_to_workspace>/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Two Wheeled Differential Drive Robot
After sourcing ROS and this package we can launch the 2-wheeled differential drive robot simulation with the following command:
```bash
ros2 launch sim_bot diff_bot.launch.py 
```

### Four Wheeled Differential Drive Robot  
After sourcing ROS and this package we can launch the 4-wheeled differential drive robot simulation with the following command:
```bash
ros2 launch sim_bot four_wheel.launch.py 
```

### Ackermann Robot needs to be ported

### Controlling the robot
By default the simulation will launch a joystick tele-operation node that will listen for a controller(xbox, ps4, etc) input. To control the robot with the keyboard set the `joy` launch argument to false.
```bash
ros2 launch sim_bot diff_bot.launch.py joy:=False
```

Then use this command in another terminal:
```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard 
```

### Launch configurations
The simulation launch files offer serveral launch configurations to modify its behaviour. All of the launch configurations available are listed below:
```bash
Config      Options         Default     Description
world:=     <path_to_world> test.world  Relative path to the simulated world.
headless:=  True/False      False       Toggle the Gazebo graphical interface. 
rviz:=      True/False      True        Activates rviz with pre-made view.
joy:=       True/False      True        Activates controller teleop support.
slam:=      True/False      True        Activates localization and mapping.
nav:=       True/False      True        Activates the navigation stack.
octomap:=   True/False      True        Activates the octomap server.
```

These configurations are the same no matter the robot type. Example launch command with custom arguments:
```bash 
ros2 launch sim_bot diff_bot.launch.py headless:=True joy:=False nav:=False
```


## Dependencies
This package is designed to require minimal set-up for robot simulation, the dependencies are as follows. xacro is used for urdf flexibility, gazebo is the simulator being used, twist-mux is used so that the robot can listen to multiple topics for velocity commands, slam-toolbox is used for localization and mapping, navigation2 is the navigation stack of the robot, and octomap lets us create a 3D representation of the enviroment.
```bash
sudo apt install -y            \
    ros-humble-xacro           \
    ros-humble-twist-mux       \
    ros-humble-navigation2     \
    ros-humble-slam-toolbox    \
    ros-humble-octomap*        \
    ros-humble-ros-gz          \ 
```


## Install
To use this package please download all of the necesary dependencies first and then follow these steps
```bash
mkdir -p sim_ws/src
cd sim_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Alexander-Levy/sim_bot.git -b humble-new-gazebo
cd ..
colcon build --symlink-install
```
Launch the simulation to test the package
```bash
source ./install/setup.bash
ros2 launch sim_bot diff_bot.launch.py 
```


## TODO 
Package is still being worked on, however the core funtionality is pretty much done, will be adding some things over the next couple of days.
 - [ ] port ackerman robot (available on `humble` and `foxy`)
